 */

//1. Define a function named `isTrue` that takes in any input and returns true if the input provided is exactly equal to `true` in value and data type.

function isTrue(input) {
    return input === true;
}

//2. Define a function named `isFalse` that takes in a value and returns a true if and only if the provided input is equal to false in both type and value.

function isFalse(input) {
    return input === false;
}

//3. Define a function named `not` that takes in any input and returns the boolean opposite of the provided input.

function not(input) {
    return !input;
}

//4. Define a function named `addOne` that takes in a single input. If the input is a number or a numeric string, return the value plus one.

//5. Define a function named `isEven` that takes in a single input. If the input is an even number or a string containing an even number, return `true`. Any other input should return false for the output.

//6. Define a function named `isIdentical` that takes in two input arguments. If each input is equal both in data type and in value, then return `true`. If the values are not the same data type or not the same value, return `false`.

//7. Define a function named `isEqual` that takes in two input arguments. If each argument is equal only in value, then return true. Otherwise return false.

//8. Define a function named `or` that takes in two input arguments. The output returned should be the result of an `or` operation on both inputs.

//9. Define a function named `and` that takes in two input arguments and returns the result of a logical `and` operation of both inputs.

//10. Define a function named `concat` that takes in two input arguments. If both arguments are strings, then return the concatenated result. If two numbers are provided, then return the string concatenation of each set of numerals.
